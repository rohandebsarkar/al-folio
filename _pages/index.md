Hello! this is Rohan Deb Sarkar. Welcome to my website.

I am currently an undergraduate student at the physics department of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, Kolkata. While Physics is my major subject, Mathematics and Computer Science are my minor subjects.

I finished my senior secondary (XII Standard) schooling from International Public School, Kolkata. My major subjects of focus were Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.

I am dedicated to science and keen to utilize my knowledge in the best interests of science, humankind, and this planet. My interests include Physics, Computer Science, and a bit of Mathematics.

I am seeking to research and learn about things that are unknown to me.
